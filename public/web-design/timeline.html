    Following the <i>Columbia</i> disaster in 2003, where the shuttle disintegrated upon re-entrance, NASA’s Investigation Board concluded that “it is in the nationʼs interest to replace the Shuttle as soon as possible as the primary means for transporting humans to and from Earth orbit.” In 2004, President George W. Bush said in his speech Vision for Space Exploration: “we will return the Space Shuttle to flight as soon as possible, consistent with safety concerns and the recommendations of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board. The Shuttle's chief purpose over the next several years will be to help finish assembly of the International Space Station. In 2010, the Space Shuttle -- after nearly 30 years of duty -- will be retired from service.” NASA followed this plan, though retirement was ultimately in 2011 instead of 2010.
